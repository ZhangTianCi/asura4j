# asura4j
The "Asura" project is a philosophy and a series of reflections on the project development system.

I hope to find more people who agree with the concept of "Ashura".

"asura4j" is only part of it.

"asura4j" is based on JDK8. 

now, i will start modules:

1. Http : a tool for send http request by java.

2. String : some verify for string , now java11-13 are has, but based on JDK8,because ,more people used 8.

3. Map : more humanize function expand .

4. Number : more humanize function expand .

5. Array :  more humanize function expand , use standardization/more robust function , to convert List and Array.

6. List :  more humanize function expand , use standardization/more robust function , to convert List and Array.
